# Using the Sidebar to match the Monokai Color Theme

This re-styles your sublime text sidebar to be dark, it fits default Monokai theme.

Save the Default.sublime-theme file into packages/Theme - Default, make a backup of your original if you want to be able to go back easily.

On Windows - finding the "Packages" folder may not be super intuitive...  Probably the easiest way to determine the path is to have Sublime find it for you by selecting "Preferences"->'Browse Packages...".  This should open the packages folder.
Create a folder called "Colorsublime-Themes" and copy this "Default.sublime-theme" file into this folder.  Once its copied the side bar should change to this new theme immediately.

Good luck!
